Voice-Controlled Smart Wheelchair 🤖🗣️🚗

Empowering mobility through AI, IoT, and embedded systems


---

Project Overview

The Voice-Controlled Smart Wheelchair is an AI-powered, voice-operated assistive device designed to provide hands-free mobility to physically challenged individuals. Using Arduino ⚙️, ultrasonic sensors 🛑, Bluetooth 📡, and Python-based AI voice recognition 🧠🎙️, the wheelchair responds to commands like forward ⬆️, backward ⬇️, left ⬅️, right ➡️, stop ✋ while avoiding obstacles automatically.
